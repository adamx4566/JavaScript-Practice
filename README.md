# JavaScript-Practice
This repository contains my practice files for learning and experimenting with JavaScript. It includes small projects and exercises where I explore dynamic behavior, DOM manipulation, functions, and interactivity in web pages.

The repository will be updated over time as I continue learning and building more advanced functionality.
